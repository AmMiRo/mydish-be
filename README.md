# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend delpoyed at Heroku (https://recipeshare-development.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm i** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm run test** to start server using testing environment

### Backend framework goes here

 NodeJs/Express/knex

-    at the beginning of the project about hald the devs knew Node/express and half knew Java/spring. Team concensus was that Node would be easier to learn for the Java folk
-    Sticking to a Javascript language framework on the front end and back end would make transitioning between front and back end teams easier when roles would need to change.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    *  PORT - local port for development
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  DB_NAME - set this to the name of your local development database
    *  DB_USERNAME - set this to the name of your local development database username, in production this is set in heroku settings. 
    *  DB_PASSWORD - set this to the name of your local development database password, in production this is set in heroku settings. 
    *  DATABASE_URL - set to your localhost and port number in development and deployment URL in production
